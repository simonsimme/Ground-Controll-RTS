/// The game's capture rule is simply "have a unit with <c>CaptureStrength</c> inside the airbase's
/// <c>CaptureRange</c>" (<c>Capture.GetInRangeUnits</c>), so a capture order is a move order into
/// the middle of the ring and nothing more — no new networking and no new state on the units. What
/// was missing was that nobody ever issued it: the player could not see which bases were takeable,
/// and the enemy commander bought units but never told them to go anywhere.
/// <para>
/// This is the one place in the mod that issues an order for a faction that is not the player's,
/// and it passes <c>playerCommand: false</c> so the Basegame treats it as the AI moving itself.

/// Capture is carried by ground vehicles, which cross the map slowly. The fast version is
/// an air assault — landing a troop-carrying helicopter inside the ring — and the machinery for it
/// already exists in <see cref="CommanderSupplyHeliService"/>, which flies a helicopter to a chosen
/// point and lands it there. It is deliberately not wired up here because it stacks three engine
/// behaviours that cannot be verified without running the game: whether a troop mount reads as a
/// cargo station, whether <c>AIHeloTransportState</c> can be forced on an aircraft that did not
/// pick it, and whether troops landed inside a ring register as capture strength. Upgrade once
