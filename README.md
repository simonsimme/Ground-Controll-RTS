<p align="center"><b>An RTS command layer for Nuclear Option.</b></p>

Pull the camera off your aircraft and command the whole battlefield: select units, queue routes,
give attack orders, build an economy, task aircraft and capture airbases. Then drop back into a
cockpit and fly the war you just planned.

It works on the base game's own missions, ships with missions
of its own, and has an enemy commander that earns, buys, builds and flies against you on the same
rules you play by.

## Requirements

- Nuclear Option
- BepInEx 5

## Installation

1. Download `GroundControlRts.zip` from the latest release.
2. In Steam, right-click Nuclear Option, then Manage, then Browse local files.
3. If there is no `BepInEx` folder, install BepInEx 5 first.
4. Extract the zip into `Nuclear Option\BepInEx\plugins`.

Keep the whole `GroundControlRts` folder, not just the DLL: the missions sit next to it.

Press `F8` in game to enter or leave RTS mode, then play the Ground Control Tutorial.

## Building from source

Requires the .NET SDK and a Nuclear Option installation with BepInEx.

```bash
dotnet build -c Release -p:GameDir="C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Nuclear Option"
```

A Release build also installs the mod into that game folder, so close the game first.
