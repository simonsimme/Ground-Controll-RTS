/// <summary>
/// The link between two copies of this mod in one multiplayer match, which is what lets a guest
/// command. Nearly everything a commander does is server-side in the base game: faction money is a
/// SyncVar, every spawn goes through the server object manager, and the AI pilots that fly Air
/// Command missions only run on the host. So a guest's click is sent here as a request, and the
/// host carries it out through the very same service code it runs for its own clicks, with
/// <see cref="ActingHq"/> standing in for "my faction". Refusals come back as the guest's red
/// banner, and the few host-side readings a guest's windows need (building levels, depot fuel, the
/// repair list, air missions) are sent back every couple of seconds.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The host speaks first. Mirage charges a player error points for every message the server has
/// no handler for, and enough of them disconnects that player, so a guest that sent anything to a
/// host without this mod could get itself kicked. A client keeps no such score, so the host
/// announcing itself to a guest that lacks the mod costs one line in that guest's log. Hence the
/// host says hello every few seconds, and a guest sends nothing until it has heard one carrying
/// its own version. The guest answers "hi", and only guests that did get the sync traffic.
/// </para>
/// <para>
///  the message is plain text split on one separator, not a typed struct per request,
/// because a typed message needs a Mirage weaver pass this project does not have. The arguments
/// are ids, jsonKeys, numbers and positions, a few dozen bytes each.
